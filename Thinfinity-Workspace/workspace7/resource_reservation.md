# How to use Resource Reservation

In this tutorial we will be using the feature Resource Reservation of Thinfinity Workplace v7. 

The main idea with this feature is give the possibility to manage when and who have accesss to different resources. Those resources could be Access to RDP sessions, applications or whatever you define in a profile. 
By default you have always access to the resource (if you have permissions), but you could determine the way on how the resource could be reserved.

For this How-to we will be creating two kind of permissions group.
  - Organizer: who could create, consume and allow to use the resource
  - Attendee: who could consume the resource
