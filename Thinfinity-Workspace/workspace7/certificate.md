# Securing the Thinfinity Workspace connection 

In this tutorial we will be reviewing how to secure the connection using https. 

We define the following scenario
- We have a Workspace already running 
- We will be using a free DNS domain
- We will be using a free public certificate

Require a DNS hostname
=

1. We will be using a DNS hostname from No-IP. We could use any provider, but in this step by step we will be using NO-IP domain.

2. Open www.noip.com and select Free Hostname. We will be creating thinfinity.servehttp.com as hostname. Complete the steps to obtain the hostname appropiated for your environment.

3. Test the connectivity using the fqdn


Require the certificate
=

1. We will be using a certificate from LetÂ´s Encrypt. To facilitate the steps, we will be using win-acme from www.win-acme.com

2. Complete the following steps in the Thinfinity primary broker
    - Downlad the application and start it
    - Select to "Create a full certificate" (option M from the menu)
    - Select "Manual input" (option 2)
    - complete with the hostname from the last step (in our case thinfinity.servehttp.com)
    - Select "Serve verification files from memory" (option 2)
    - Select "RSA key" (option 2)
    - Select "Windows Certificate Store" (option 4)
    - Select "My computer store" (option 1)
    - Select "No additional store steps" (option 5)
    - Select "No additional installation steps" (option 4)
    - Complete steps


Configure Thinkfinity Workplace to use the certificate
=

1. Open Thinfinity Workplace Configuration and select General tab

2. Create a new protocol, select and configure the following
    - Protocol : HTTPS
    - Certificate : you will see the recently certificate created
    - Click OK and Apply
        
3. Login to the Thinkfinity Workplace using the FQDN recently created. Review the certificate validity.
