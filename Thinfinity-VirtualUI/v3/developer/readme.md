# Deploying Thinfinity VirtualUI in the Developer workstation

In this tutorial we will be deploying and configuring Thinfinity Virtual UI in the developer workstation. 

We define the following scenario
- We have a Windows workstation to be used as developer with for example Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition 
- We have the Thinfinity Workplace environment already deployed 

Download and configure the virtual UI
=

1. Ask for the Virtual UI installer

2. Run the VirtualUI to deploy the application but only select "Development environment" using the defaults (C:\Program Files\Thinfinity\VirtualUI)


Test an example
=

1. Download the VB .NET example from https://www.cybelesoft.com/thinfinity/virtualui/tutorials/

2. Unzip the file

3. Using "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" move up to the directory where you place the VB.NET example

4. Type "code ." and Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition will be open with the VB.NET solution

5. IF you dont have .Net Framework 4.52 Developer Pack already deployed, install it because in this example we need an old .NET framework to show a real life situation.. how to provide a quick modern interfaz to an old application

6. If you want to modify something of the application, you could do it and then Build it


Deploy and access the example
