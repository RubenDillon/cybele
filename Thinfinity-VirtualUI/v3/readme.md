In this git you will find step by step on how you could use VirtualUI inside different development environments like C#, Visual Basic .NET and so on.

You will find a Developer folder where I explain how a developer will use all this technology. In that step by step we create an application from scratch and then, we transform it to use it with Thinfinity Virtual UI.
