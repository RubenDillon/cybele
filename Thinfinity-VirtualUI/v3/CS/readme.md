# Using Thinfinity VirtualUI with C#

In this tutorial we will be configuring Thinfinity Virtual UI with a C# application. We will expose a Windows Form C# application to the internet using Thinfinity Workplace. 

We define the following scenario
- We have a WinForm C# application already working or we will be using the example of this git
- We already have deployed Thinfinity Workplace 

Download and configure the application

2. Unzip the file and open it using for example Visual Studio 2022

3. Open the file frmMyOwnApp.cs and go to "private void Initialize()" 

4. You will find a lot of code there, because this is a very good example with a lot of features, but the more important in those lines are the code that you need to put your Windows Form application in a web

5. The lines that you need pay attention are basically
```
....
vui = new Cybele.Thinfinity.VirtualUI();
....
vui.Start();

```

6. The rest of lines are to improve and configure in a particular way the relationship between how Windows Form works and the Web based implementation do the job

7. Copy the file to the Server where you want to run this application.
